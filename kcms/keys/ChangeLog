	in keyconfig.cpp 
	
1998-12-19 Duncan Haldane <f.d.m.haldane@cwix.com>
	* Converted global.cpp, global.h to keyconfig.cpp,
	keyconfig.h, that can now be used to configure both
	the standard keys  and the global keys 
	in the same sophisticated manner as  
	global.cpp did for just the global keys.
	* converted main.cpp to use keyconfig.cpp rather than
	global.cpp and standard.cpp for standard and globall
	key configuration.  KGlobalConfig and KStdConfig disappear. 
	(KGlobalConfig is renamed to KKeyConfig)
	* appropriate changes to Makefile.am.
	* standard key binding are now #include'd from
	stdbindings.cpp
        *  standard.cpp, standard.h are left here for now.
	The entries that used to use them in main.cpp and
	Makefile.am are just commented out for now.
