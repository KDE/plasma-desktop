"<p>This module allows you to have an overview of all plugins of the KDE "
"Daemon, also referred to as KDE Services. Generally, there are two types of "
"service:</p> <ul><li>Services invoked at startup</li><li>Services called on "
"demand</li></ul> <p>The latter are only listed for convenience. The startup "
"services can be started and stopped. You can also define whether services "
"should be loaded at startup.</p> <p><b>Use this with care: some services are "
"vital for Plasma; do not deactivate services if you  do not know what you "
"are doing.</b></p>"
